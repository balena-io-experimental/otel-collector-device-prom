  OpenTelemetry Collector for device monitoring to a Prometheus backend.

  ## Getting Started

  1. If you don't already have a Prometheus backend setup, create an account at [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/), and set up a Linux Server integration.

  2. Create a docker-compose file with 'otel-collector' and 'node-exporter' service entries, like [this example](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/otel-collector-device-prom/blob/master/docs/example).

  3. Create a fleet in balenaCloud dashboard, and push the service composition to it.

  4. Set fleet variables for the 'otel-collector' service for the Prometheus remote write URL, username, and password used by the integration.


  See the project [README](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/otel-collector-device-prom#readme) for specifics.
